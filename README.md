# LMDPs
Linearly-solvable Markov Decision Processes 


Linearly-solvable Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs) are a class of processes for which the optimal Bellman equation can be reduced to a linear system. In this project, we aim at investigating the strength of the assumptions of LMDPs and illustrate in which settings it is interesting to use these decision processes. Firstly, we present LMDPs, their assumptions
and the most important equations that can be derived in different settings. Secondly,
we present examples of applications in which the LMDP theory can be exploited.
