# LMDPs
Linearly-solvable Markov Decision Processes 


In this report, we aim at investigating the strength of the Linearly-solvable Markov Decision
Processes (LMDPs) assumptions and illustrate in which settings it is interesting to use these decision processes. We present the basis of the LMDPs, a class of processes for which the optimal Bellman equation
can be reduced to a linear system. Firstly, we present LMDPs, their assumptions
and the most important equations that can be derived in different settings. Secondly,
we present examples of applications in which the LMDP theory can be exploited.
